Description: LassoNet  package contains functions to estimate a penalized regression model using 3CoSE algorithm described in the paper Striaukas and Weber (2018). Regression model has two penalty terms: 1) standard lasso and 2) network. Using this package, you can estimate both regression coefficients and network connection signs. In addition, there is a separate file (replicated.R) that replicates simulation results of the paper Striaukas and Weber (2018).
